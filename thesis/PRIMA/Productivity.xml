        <ab>Cyber security threats were a concern before the Covid-19 pandemic. But a year after businesses and employees vacated office complexes, the risks of falling victim to a cyber attack have only grown. In an article published by the Journal of Medical Internet Research, researchers found that the number of cyber attacks increased by 500% throughout the pandemic, and by 2021 are on track to cost world businesses $6tr annually.1</ab>

        <ab>Reducing airborne infectious risk is crucial for controlling infectious respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19). The airborne transmissibility of COVID-19 is high so that the common ventilation rate may be insufficient to dilute the airborne pathogens, particularly in public buildings with a relatively large occupancy density. Reducing occupancy can reduce the pathogen load thereby reducing airborne infection risk. However, reduced occupancy deteriorates work productivity due to the lost hours of work. This study proposes an occupancy-aided ventilation strategy for constraining the airborne infection risk and minimizing the loss of work productivity. Firstly, two mechanisms of occupancy schedule (alternative changeovers between normal occupancy and reduced occupancy) for reducing the airborne infection risk and loss of work productivity are revealed based on analyzing features of the indoor concentration profile of exhaled aerosols. Secondly, optimization of the occupancy schedule is developed to maximize the total time length of normal occupancy for the minimum loss in work productivity while satisfying the constraint on airborne infection risk (e.g., with the reproduction number less than one). The airborne infection risk is evaluated with the rebreathed fraction model. Case studies on COVID-19 in a classroom demonstrate that the proposed occupancy-aided ventilation is effective with an earning ratio of 1.67 (the ratio of the improvement in health outcome to the loss in work productivity) and is robust to the variable occupancy loads and occupancy flexibilities.</ab>

        <ab>More freedom, more flexibility, and reduced travel time for knowledge workers are just a few advantages of new work models, which have been discussed for several years now. Moreover, the problem of rural depopulation can be addressed by this concept. In the research project “Digital Teams”, we aim to develop a digital open-source platform to support and optimize the digital work environment for distributed teams in rural areas, especially in the knowledge work context. In this article, we focus on the research and design aspects of the project. We provide insights on how we have used the design thinking approach for our research and for the development of the UX- and UI-design concepts. We are focusing on an ecosystem concept, which provides all relevant services for knowledge workers in their daily work life, rather than focusing on a specific remote collaboration purpose.</ab>

        <ab>Digitalization is a process that started already years ago and shows increasing dynamics. Since latest the year 2011 – when the vision of Industry 4.0 was presented – digitalization dynamics increase also in production industry. Simultaneously, manifold and partially far reaching expectations on the digitalization’s impact on productivity and its management as well as on employees and work design came up. To gain information on the current state of digitalization as well as the related experiences and expectations three studies have been conducted by ifaa in the years 2015, 2017 and 2019 in the German metal and electrical industry. Now integrated analyses of these studies and especially of some replicated questions have been conducted to recognize development tendencies and gain further knowledge on the digitalization’s development. In this way, several development tendencies were found, and assumptions were derived for explaining them. These include expectations on productivity gain, importance of digitalization for selected fields of application, the use of lean methods and holistic approaches as well as the impact on employees, their number, and their flexibility.</ab>

        <ab>The physical work environment of software engineers can have various effects on their satisfaction and the ability to get the work done. To better understand the factors of the environment that affect productivity and satisfaction of software engineers, we explored different work environments at Microsoft. We used a mixed-methods, multiple stage research design with a total of 1,159 participants: two surveys with 297 and 843 responses respectively and interviews with 19 employees. We found several factors that were considered as important for work environments: personalization, social norms and signals, room composition and atmosphere, work-related environment affordances, work area and furniture, and productivity strategies . We built statistical models for satisfaction with the work environment and perceived productivity of software engineers and compared them to models for employees in the Program Management, IT Operations, Marketing, and Business Program &amp; Operations disciplines. In the satisfaction models, the ability to work privately with no interruptions and the ability to communicate with the team and leads were important factors among all disciplines. In the productivity models, the overall satisfaction with the work environment and the ability to work privately with no interruptions were important factors among all disciplines. For software engineers, another important factor for perceived productivity was the ability to communicate with the team and leads. We found that private offices were linked to higher perceived productivity across all disciplines.</ab>

        <ab>Comparable estimates of the heat-related work productivity loss (WPL) in different countries over the world are difficult partly due to the lack of exact measures and comparable data for different counties. In this study, we analysed 4363 responses to a global online survey on the WPL during heat waves in 2016. The participants were from both developed and developing countries, facilitating estimates of the heat-related WPL across the world for the year. The heat-related WPL for each country involved was then deduced for increases of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C in the global mean surface temperature under the representative concentration pathway scenarios in climate models. The average heat-related WPL in 2016 was 6.6 days for developing countries and 3.5 days for developed countries. The estimated heat-related WPL was negatively correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. When global surface temperatures increased by 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C, the corresponding WPL was 9 (19), 12 (31), 22 (61) and 33 (94) days for developed (developing) countries, quantifying how developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change from a particular point of view. Moreover, the heat-related WPL was unevenly distributed among developing countries. In a 2°C-warmer world, the heat-related WPL would be more than two months in Southeast Asia, the most influenced region. The results are considerable for developing strategy of adaptation especially for developing countries.</ab>

        <ab>We are developing a shared remote control mobile robot for aerial work in nuclear power plants (NPPs); a robot consists of a mobile platform, a telescopic mast, and a dual-arm slave with a working tool. It is used at a high location operating the manual operation mechanism of a fuel changer of a heavy water NPP. The robot system can cut/weld a pipe remotely in the case of an emergency or during the dismantling of the NPP. Owing to the challenging control mission considering limited human operator cognitive capability, some remote tasks require a shared control scheme, which demands systematic software design and integration. Therefore, we designed the architecture of the software systematically.</ab>

        <ab>The importance of office facilities and workplace environment in the university system cannot be overemphasized because office facilities help in facilitating work schedules and increase staff's efficiency and productivity. Unfortunately, in many universities in the developing countries such as Nigeria, there are in-adequate facilities in the staff offices, and such has resulted in low productivity and has impacted negatively in universities' global ranking. The study assessed the facilities provided in the staff offices at the federal university of technology Akure Nigeria and examined the essential facilities that influence staff productivity. A total of 204 questionnaires were administered to both the academic and non-academic staff members drawn from the eight (8) academic schools that are in the university. 184 of the administered questionnaires were retrieved from the respondents representing 90.2% and therefore served as the basis for the analysis. A descriptive method of analysis was used to analyze the data. The study revealed that the conditions of fire prevention facilities such as fire extinguisher installed for workers are not functional; the same applies to the toilet facilities. Also, the further revealed that the staffs are very dissatisfied with the condition of conveniences and the state of the sofa in the offices. Finally, the study revealed that the most relevant facilities that influence staff productivity are water, electricity, and Wi-Fi. The study, therefore, recommends that the universities should make adequate provision for water, toilet, electricity, sofa, and fire extinguishers in the staff offices as these have the potential of motivating workers for greater commitment and higher productivity.</ab>

        <ab>Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) has significant impacts on office occupants' productivity and these impacts differ according to the type of office. The present study focuses on a special type of open-plan offices, university open-plan research offices (UOROs), and aims to study how the IEQ of this type of offices affects the occupants' productivity. A four-part IEQ assessment framework for the University Open-plan Research Office (UORO) is first proposed. Then the investigation is conducted based on survey responses collected from 231 people who are working in UOROs from 19 universities in China. The analysis results show a clear picture of (1) how the office productivity is affected by the five key IEQ aspects (layout, air quality, thermal comfort, lighting and acoustic environment), (2) how these five key IEQ aspects are affected by their corresponding sub-factors, such as conversation noise, and (3) how occupants' perception of sub-factors are affected by individual factors, such as occupant demographics and work activity. The results also emphasize the quality of acoustic environment has the greatest influence on the occupants' productivity in UOROs and imply occupants working in UOROs have higher requirements for acoustic environment than in other common types of open-plan offices. Based on the analysis, a decision-making strategy is also presented for the evaluation and improvement of the IEQ of UOROs.</ab>

        <ab>The work on the factory floor is gradually changing to resemble knowledge work due to highly automated manufacturing machines. In the increasingly automated work environment, the machine operator's task is to keep the production running and to solve possible problems quickly. This work is expected to become more autonomous, which raises the importance of supporting the workers' well-being. An important aspect of that is giving concrete feedback of success at work as well as feedback on physical and mental load. We implemented a smartphone optimized web application, Worker Feedback Dashboard that offers feedback to machine operators about their well-being at work and personally relevant production data as well as their connections to each other. The feedback is personal and based on objective, near real-time measurements. We present the results of a field study, in which ten machine operators used the application for 2–3 months. We studied the operators' user experience, usage activity, perceived benefits and concerns for the application with questionnaires, interviews and application log data. The operators found the feedback interesting and beneficial, and used the application actively. The perceived benefits indicate impacts on well-being as well as on work performance. Based on the results, we highlight three design implications for quantified worker applications: presenting meaningful overviews, providing guidance to act based on the feedback and refraining from too pervasive quantification not to narrow down the meaningful aspects in one's work.</ab>

        <ab>New digital and remote work practices challenge city planning and urban design as they move economic activities from city centres to residential suburbs. Little is known about the spatial impact of these new work patterns on suburbia. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through a design charrette conducted in the City of Gold Coast, Australia. Despite often working individually, remote workers favour design interventions that facilitate a transformation of suburbia towards multi-use. Urban design strategies supporting new work practices in residential neighbourhoods can enable better collaboration and innovation, create new opportunities for third spaces, and unlock a city's competitive advantage.</ab>

        <ab>The pandemic period developed new work behaviors. Home office and teleworking took the place of office work. This period affected certain organizational activities and developed new opportunities to work. Teleworkers are affected by several factors during this pandemic period. This paper presents the dataset of a survey on workplace human resource home office strategies applied by companies and perceived by employees from the west region in Romania during the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope is to understand the changing mentality pre and post COVID-19 so that companies can adapt to ensure both the physical and mentally health of their employees. It is believed that this is not just a stage, but the beginning of the new normality.</ab>

        <ab>Susanne Boll recounts her experience as a telepresence robot attending this year’s ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), illustrating the fusion of the state of the art in robotics, long-distance interaction, and shared remote-audio-visual experiences. As a researcher in human computer interaction, yet with an international team facing restricted travel owing to the newly imposed US travel ban, she opted for remote participation at CHI 2017. Furthermore, as a member of the multimedia community, she wanted to explore first-hand how multimedia is at work in the field of telepresence.</ab>

        <ab>Purpose: Due to lack of motivation, individuals often fail to perform regular exercise. In view of this, we developed a virtual trainer system (VTS) to encourage users to perform simple exercise routines regularly. Design/methodology/approach: A design science approach is adopted to develop a VTS to motivate users to exercise. Study findings are based on a field experiment with 91 participants recruited from a university in Hong Kong. Findings: Outcome-oriented reminders foster stronger perceived risks of health and perceived value of exercises, whereas virtual trainer attractiveness has insignificant effect. Perceived value of exercises is positively related to exercise participation, which has a positive relationship with work productivity. Research limitations/implications: The findings answer question of how to motivate people to continue exercising. Practical implications: Findings provide insights for fitness companies to design online exercise training for users. Social implications: VTS can promote regular exercise and healthy life. Originality/value: This research shows that interactive virtual agents can motivate users to exercise regularly. It contributes to the burgeoning research on the use of IT artifacts for improving exercise participation and provides practical insights into VTS designs.</ab>

        <ab>The world has seen major developments in the field of e-learning and distance learning, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, which revealed the importance of these two types of education and the fruitful benefits they have offered in a group of countries, especially those that have excellent infrastructure. At the Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University Marrakech, Morocco, we have created a simple electronic platform for remote practical work (RPW), and its results have been good in terms of student interaction and even facilitating the employment of a professor. The objective of this work is to propose a recommendation system based on deep quality-learning networks (DQNs) to recommend and direct students in advance of doing the RPW according to their skills of each mouse or keyboard click per student. We are focusing on this technology because it has strong, tremendous visibility and problem-solving ability that we will demonstrate in the result section. Our platform has enabled us to collect a range of students’ and teachers’ information and their interactions with the learning content we will rely on as inputs (a large number of images per second for each mouse or keyboard click per student) into our new system for output (doing the RPW). This technique is reflected in an attempt to embody the virtual teacher’s image within the platform and then adequately trained with DQN technology to perform the RPW.</ab>

        <ab>The study of productivity effects of changes in education, work experience, and age of labor force is of paramount importance because it has a direct impact on high and low performers among organizations. However, there is a significant gap in studies on exploring the quality of such work-life in Indonesia. This study seeks to analyze 1) the productivity effects of changes in education and age of the labor sector; 2) the productivity effect of work experience; and (4) the productivity effects of wages on craftsmen's lurik weaving fabric in Klaten district of Indonesia. The results drawn from this study show that 1) the level of education has significant effects on labor productivity; 2) the age composition of the labor force has a significant impact on productivity; 3) work experience can make a significant influence on labor productivity though it has a negative value; and 4) work wages cannot significantly influence on labor productivity.</ab>

        <ab>Multiple monitors are commonly used in the workplace nowadays. This study compares user productivity and windows management style (WMS) on single- and dual-monitor work stations for engineering tasks of three complexity levels. Four productivity measures including task time, cursor movement, the number of window switches, and the number of mouse clicks were compared. The results showed that dual-monitor setting resulted in significantly less window switches and mouse clicks. Most users preferred dual-monitor setting. To understand how users manage multiple windows in completing their tasks, a new WMS categorization method is proposed, toggler and resizer, and user behavior was categorized into one of these two styles. More users adopted “toggler” style, but as the task complexity level increased, some “toggler” style users switched to “resizer” style.</ab>

        <ab>The world has seen major developments in the field of e-learning and distance learning, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, which revealed the importance of these two types of education and the fruitful benefits they have offered in a group of countries, especially those that have excellent infrastructure. At the Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Cadi Ayyad University Marrakech, Morocco, we have created a simple electronic platform for remote practical work (RPW), and its results have been good in terms of student interaction and even facilitating the employment of a professor. The objective of this work is to propose a recommendation system based on deep quality-learning networks (DQNs) to recommend and direct students in advance of doing the RPW according to their skills of each mouse or keyboard click per student. We are focusing on this technology because it has strong, tremendous visibility and problem-solving ability that we will demonstrate in the result section. Our platform has enabled us to collect a range of students' and teachers' information and their interactions with the learning content we will rely on as inputs (a large number of images per second for each mouse or keyboard click per student) into our new system for output (doing the RPW). This technique is reflected in an attempt to embody the virtual teacher's image within the platform and then adequately trained with DQN technology to perform the RPW.</ab>

        <ab>We are developing a shared remote control mobile robot for aerial work in nuclear power plants (NPPs); a robot consists of a mobile platform, a telescopic mast, and a dual-arm slave with a working tool. It is used at a high location operating the manual operation mechanism of a fuel changer of a heavy water NPP. The robot system can cut/weld a pipe remotely in the case of an emergency or during the dismantling of the NPP. Owing to the challenging control mission considering limited human operator cognitive capability, some remote tasks require a shared control scheme, which demands systematic software design and integration. Therefore, we designed the architecture of the software systematically. Keywords: Aerial Work, Nuclear Power Plant, Shared Remote Control Robot</ab>

        <ab>Crises are well known for their ability to create significant economic, social and political changes. In their midst, however, it is often difficult to identify those new trends that will last well beyond the crisis. That can make planning to resolve major problems difficult until the crisis eases or passes. To facilitate useful contingent planning, this paper outlines a process for identifying those trend breezes most likely to endure and be true and impactful trends. It then applies this analytical process to the huge increase in remote working that the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked. The analysis demonstrates that remote work was growing before the crisis, has other trends that reinforce it and that employees and employers have strong non-health reasons to continue a robust level of its use. Moreover, remote work probably will have significant economic impacts on urban, suburban and rural communities long after the pandemic eases. It thrives best in the industries most dependent on creative/knowledge workers and a critical mass of them are now committed to remote working. Employers that refuse to oblige them are likely to have a more difficult time recruiting and retaining such highly skilled and much sought after workers, especially since they are already in short supply.</ab>

        <ab>Work sampling is a very effective tool for measuring and monitoring the performances of construction crews. Work measurement was conducted at 3 different sites with their unique qualities. Productivity was measured for crews comprising of one mason (skilled worker) and one helper (unskilled worker)-1M (Mason)+1H (Helper). Enough observations were made to ensure a 95% confidence limit and ± 5% accuracy of sampling results. Block work and internal wall plastering were chosen for work study. These works were divided into their elements. Sampling was done by categorizing work elements as Direct Work (DW), Indirect Work (IW) and Not Working or Idle (NW). The regression analysis on the work sampling data shows that observed quantity is having very low correlation with DW content and satisfactory correlation with working content (DW+IW). Results of sampling show that shares of DW, IW and NW are 56%, 27% and 17% for observed works respectively. Labor Utilization Factor (LUF) given by the sum of direct work and half of indirect work is around 69% for all works. The values of LUFs for all sites are in good range and help in monitoring trends. The direct work content is almost twice as indirect contributory work for both works in all sites. 1M+1H crew composition is found to be optimum and economical compared to 2M+1H and 1M+2H combinations. The major cause of delays in all sites is found to be waiting for materials and equipment.</ab>

Following the economic development theories, we tested three hypotheses about economic equilibrium based both on work productivity across the national economy and also on work productivity in each of the four industries as presented in the National Classification of Economic Activities in Romania (CAEN, Rev. 2), with official data of the period 2000-2015.Our findings highlight a series of forms of interdependency across the four industries of the national economy as well as some potential economic sustainability vulnerabilities of the Romanian primary sector, thus forming a solid reasoning for future sustainable economic development.</ab>

        <ab>The challenge of high-performance maneuvers for a deep-ocean underwater vehicle is to design proper controllers and ensure the high accuracy of vehicle state measurements. Current underwater vehicle control solutions are considered to be a unique controller designed to reject the disturbance and noise. However, the controller is based on a precise hydrodynamic model. It requires multiple underwater experiments and complex theoretical analysis. In this article, a hybrid control strategy is presented for the work-class remote operated vehicle. It tries to compose several proportion-integral-differential controllers into one intelligent sequence in terms of task requirements. The proposed approach employs the iterative learning method to improve the performance of the depth holding and the way-point tracking. A remote operated vehicle system weighted about 1.5 tons is provided as a physical platform for scientific investigations using acoustic Doppler current profiler, inertial navigation system, depth sensor, and an altimeter. Results from the simulation and the experiment in the basin show that the proposed approach provides high accuracy at both conditions: tracking way-points with or without ocean currents and disturbances, which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, the thrust vector defined for a propeller facilitates the control of underwater vehicle as the thruster configuration changes.</ab>

        <ab>Online marketplaces foster electronic business on a global basis through standardised payment systems, logistics management, and interface designs. However, such standardised processes and features make it difficult for sellers in these marketplaces to differentiate from each other and achieve superior performance. In this study, we posit that entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) and remote work self-efficacy (RWSE) of sellers play a synergistic role in enabling operational creativity, which in turn is a critical antecedent to their performance. We found supportive evidence for these hypotheses by analysing survey data on 267 sellers from Taobao.com, a major online marketplace in China.</ab>
