Abstract = {Driver fatigue has become a leading cause of accidents and death in the transportation industry. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based fatigue detection can be a good way to reduce accidents and improve safety and efficiencies throughout the transportation system. In this article, we focus on investigating whether the spatial–temporal changes in the relations between EEG channels are specific to different driving states. EEG signals were first partitioned into several segments, and the covariance matrices obtained from each segment were input into a recurrent neural network to extract high-level temporal features. Meanwhile, the covariance matrices of whole signals were leveraged to extract spatial characteristics that were fused with temporal features to obtain comprehensive spatial–temporal information. In experiments on an open benchmark dataset, our method achieved an excellent classification accuracy of 89.28% and showed superior performance compared to several other state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that our method can enable higher performance in driver fatigue detection.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been proven to be one of the most predictive and reliable indicators for estimating driving fatigue state. However, how to make full use of EEG data for driving fatigue detection remains a challenge. Many existing methods include a time-consuming manual process or tedious parameter tunings for feature extraction, which is inconvenient to train and implement. On the other hand, most models ignore or manually determine EEG connectivity features between different channels, thus failing to thoroughly exploit the intrinsic interchannel relations for classification. In this article, we introduce a new attention-based multiscale convolutional neural network-dynamical graph convolutional network (AMCNN-DGCN) model, aiming to conquer these two issues in a unified end-to-end model. AMCNN-DGCN starts with attention-based multiscale temporal convolutions to automatically learn frequency filters to extract the salient pattern from raw EEG data. Subsequently, AMCNN-DGCN uses dynamical graph convolutional networks (DGCNs) to learn spatial filters, in which the adjacency matrix is adaptively determined in a data-driven way to exploit the intrinsic relationship between channels effectively. With the temporal-spatial structure, AMCNN-DGCN can capture highly discriminative features. To verify the effectiveness of AMCNN-DGCN, we conduct a simulated fatigue driving environment to collect EEG signals from 29 healthy subjects (male/female = 17/12 and age = 23.28±2.70 years) through a remote wireless cap with 24 channels. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms six widely used competitive EEG models with high accuracy of 95.65%. Finally, the critical brain regions and connections for driving fatigue detection were investigated through the dynamically learned adjacency matrix.},

Abstract = {Biological long short-term memory (B-LSTM) can effectively help human process all kinds of received information. In this work, a memristive B-LSTM circuit which mimics a conversion from short-term memory to long-term memory is proposed. That is, the stronger the signal, the more profound the memory and the higher the output. On this basis, an image binarization circuit using adaptive row threshold algorithm is proposed. It can make the image remain a deep impression on the strong pixel information and effectively filter the relatively weak pixel information. In combination with the function of image binarization, a memristive circuit for eyes state detection is proposed by adding corresponding horizontal projection calculation, subtraction calculation and judgement open or closed eyes modules. The proposed circuit can detect whether there is a blink between two adjacent facial images, which uses the characteristics of memristor to detect the difference of horizontal projection between two images. Due to the use of memristor, the proposed circuit can realize in-memory computing, which fundamentally avoids the problem of storage wall and shorten the execution time. Finally, an expectation application in fatigue driving based on the proposed method is demonstrated, which indicates the practicability of the circuit design in this work.},

Abstract = {Damage detection is an inevitable part of composite laminate product verification during both manufacture and maintenance inspections. The article presents a damage characterization method to detect and quantize the fatigue damage in composite laminates. The cross recurrence plot (CRP) of Lamb signal is introduced to assess the dynamic difference between the composite laminates in undamaged and damaged states. The cross recursive quantification analysis features derived from the CRPs are optimally selected and fused into a damage value (DV) based on the support vector data description model. Then, the DVs of diagnostic paths are integrated into a unified damage index for quantizing the fatigue damage of composite laminate subjected to the cyclic loading. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the simulation data acquired from the finite element models with different severity degrees of microcracking and the fatigue damage progressing data from NASA prognostics data repository.},

Abstract = {Brain activities can be evaluated by using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. One of the primary reasons for traffic accidents is driver fatigue, which can be identified by using EEG signals. This work aims to achieve a highly accurate and straightforward process to detect driving fatigue by using EEG signals. Two main problems, which are feature generation and feature selection, are defined to achieve this aim. This work solves these problems by using two different approaches. Deep networks are efficient feature generators and extract features in low, medium, and high levels. These features can be generated by using multileveled or multilayered feature extraction. Therefore, we proposed a multileveled feature generator that uses a one-dimensional binary pattern (BP) and statistical features together, and levels are created using a one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1D-DWT). A five-level fused feature extractor is presented by using BP, statistical features of 1D-DWT together. Moreover, a 2-layered feature selection method is proposed using ReliefF and iterative neighborhood component analysis (RFINCA) to solve the feature selection problem. The goals of the RFINCA are to choose the optimal number of features automatically and use the effectiveness of ReliefF and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) together. A driving fatigue EEG dataset was used as a testbed to denote the effectiveness of eighteen conventional classifiers. According to the experimental results, a highly accurate EEG classification approach is presented. The proposed method also reached 100.0% classification accuracy by using a k-nearest neighborhood classifier.},

Abstract = {Most of existing eye movement-based fatigue detectors utilize statistical analysis of fixations, saccades, and blinks as inputs. Nevertheless, these parameters require long recording time and heavily depend on eye trackers. In an effort to facilitate proactive detection of mental fatigue, we introduced a complemental fatigue indicator, named gaze-bin analysis, which simply presents the eye-tracking data with histograms. A method which engaged the gaze-bin analysis as inputs of semisupervised bagged trees was developed. A case study in a vessel traffic service center demonstrated that this approach can alleviate the burden of manual labeling as well as improve the performance of fatigue detection model. In addition, the results show that the approach can achieve an excellent accuracy of 89%, which outperformed other methods. In general, this study provided a complemental indicator for detecting mental fatigue as well as enabled the application of a low sampling rate eye tracker in the traffic control center.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG)-based driving fatigue detection has gained increasing attention recently due to the non-invasive, low-cost, and potable nature of the EEG technology, but it is still challenging to extract informative features from noisy EEG signals for driving fatigue detection. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network has drawn lots of attention as a promising classifier due to its linear-in-the-parameters network structure, strong non-linear approximation ability, and desired generalization property. The RBF network performance heavily relies on network parameters such as the number of the hidden nodes, number of the center vectors, width, and output weights. However, global optimization methods that directly optimize all the network parameters often result in high evaluation cost and slow convergence. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of EEG-based driving fatigue detection model, this study aims to develop a two-level learning hierarchy RBF network (RBF-TLLH) which allows for global optimization of the key network parameters. Experimental EEG data were collected, at both fatigue and alert states, from six healthy participants in a simulated driving environment. Principal component analysis was first utilized to extract features from EEG signals, and the proposed RBF-TLLH was then employed for driving status (fatigue vs. alert) classification. The results demonstrated that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach achieved a better classification performance (mean accuracy: 92.71%; area under the receiver operating curve: 0.9199) compared to other widely used artificial neural networks. Moreover, only three core parameters need to be determined using the training datasets in the proposed RBF-TLLH classifier, which increases its reliability and applicability. The findings demonstrate that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach can be used as a promising framework for reliable EEG-based driving fatigue detection.},

Abstract = {With a focus on fatigue driving detection research, a fully automated driver fatigue status detection algorithm using driving images is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the multitask cascaded convolutional network (MTCNN) architecture is employed in face detection and feature point location, and the region of interest (ROI) is extracted using feature points. A convolutional neural network, named EM-CNN, is proposed to detect the states of the eyes and mouth from the ROI images. The percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS) and mouth opening degree (POM) are two parameters used for fatigue detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EM-CNN can efficiently detect driver fatigue status using driving images. The proposed algorithm EM-CNN outperforms other CNN-based methods, i.e., AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and ResNet50, showing accuracy and sensitivity rates of 93.623% and 93.643%, respectively.

Abstract = {Fatigue driving is one of the main factors which affect the safety of drivers and passengers in mountain freeway. To improve the driving safety, the application of fatigue driving detection system is a crucial measure. Accuracy, speed and robustness are key performances of fatigue detection system. However, most researches pay attention to one of them, instead of taking care of them all. It has limitation in practical application. This paper proposes a novel three-layered framework, named Real-time and Robust Detection System. Specifically, the framework includes three modules, called facial feature extraction, eyes regions extraction and fatigue detection. In the facial feature extraction module, the paper designs a deep cascaded convolutional neural network to detect the face and locate eye key points. Then, a face tracking sub-module is constructed to increase the speed of the algorithm, and a face validation submodule is applied to improve the stability of detection. Furthermore, to ensure the orderly operation of each sub-module, we designed a recognition loop based on the finite state machine. It can extract facial feature of the driver. In the second module, eyes regions of the driver were captured according to the geometric feature of face and eyes. In the fatigue detection module, the ellipse fitting method is applied to obtain the shape of driver’s pupils. According to the relationship between the long and short axes of the ellipse, eyes state (opening or closed) can be decided. Lastly, the PERCLOS, which is defined by calculating the number of closed eyes in a period, is used to determine whether fatigue driving or not. The experimental results show that the comprehensive accuracy of fatigue detection is 95.87%. The average algorithm rate is 32.29 ms/f in an image of 640×480 pixels. The research results can serve the design of a new generation of driver fatigue detection system to mountain freeway.},

Abstract = {In recent years, fatigue driving has been a serious threat to the traffic safety, which makes the research of fatigue detection a hotspot field. Research on fatigue recognition has a great significance to improve the traffic safety. However, the existing fatigue detection methods still have room for improvement in detection accuracy and efficiency. In order to detect whether the driver has fatigue driving, this paper proposes a fatigue state recognition algorithm. The method first uses MTCNN (multitask convolutional neural network) to detect human face, and then DLIB (an open-source software library) is used to locate facial key points to extract the fatigue feature vector of each frame. The fatigue feature vectors of multiple frames are spliced into a temporal feature sequence and sent to the LSTM (long short-term memory) network to obtain a final fatigue feature value. Experiments show that compared with other methods, the fatigue state recognition algorithm proposed in this paper has achieved better results in accuracy. The average accuracy of the proposed method in detecting key points of the face is as high as 93%, and the running time is less than half of the ordinary DLIB method.},

Abstract = {The utilization of upper extremity exoskeleton robots has been proved to be a scientifically effective approach for rehabilitation training. In the process of rehabilitation training, it is necessary to detect the fatigue degree during rehabilitation training in order to formulate a reasonable training plan and achieve better training efficiency. Based on the integral value of surface electromyography (sEMG), heart rate variability, and instantaneous heart rate, this article proposes a fatigue judgment method for multi-information fusion. Based on the integral value data, the feature extraction of the bioelectrical signals were implemented separately, then the fatigue recognition was conducted using the decision-level data fusion method. The bioelectrical signal acquisition system of electromyogram signals and electrocardiograph signals was developed for upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot, and the acquisition and processing of electromyogram signals and electrocardiograph signals were completed. Finally, the fuzzy logic controller with instantaneous heart rate, heart rate variability, and surface electromyography signal was designed to judge fatigue degree, including the fuzzy device, fuzzy rule selector, and defuzzifier. The moderate fatigue state data were selected for testing, and the experimental results showed that the error of fatigue judgment is 4.3%, which satisfies the requirements of fatigue judgment.},

Abstract = {Polyelectrolyte complex hydrogel (PECH) is an emerging ion conductive hydrogel made from non-covalent interacted oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in water. However, the construction of PECH with high stretchability, excellent fatigue resistance and self-healability is heavily demanded while remaining a profound challenge. Herein, a hydrogen-bonded network densification strategy is presented for preparing a highly stretchable and deformation-tolerant PECH hydrogel (Fe/CS/PAA), which is composed of an anionic Fe3+-coordinated polyacrylic acid network (Fe-PAA) and cationic Fe3+-coordinated chitosan network (Fe-CS). Benefiting from the formation of dense hydrogen-bonded network between the Fe-PAA and Fe-CS networks activated by salt impregnation, the resultant densified hydrogen-bonded Fe/CS/PAA hydrogel (DHB-Fe/CS/PAA) exhibits large tensile strength (~0.34 MPa), high stretchability (~1370%), low-temperature resistance to −25 °C, and heat-accelerated self-healability. Due to its high stretchability, excellent fatigue resistance and high ionic conductivity, the DHB-Fe/CS/PAA can readily work as a stretchable ionic conductor for skin-inspired ionic strain sensor, displaying high sensitivity in a wide strain range (0.5%–500%), fast response time (<180 ms) and excellent durability for 500 cycles at a 100% strain. Besides, the as-assembled ionic sensor is capable of maintaining high ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness at a sub-zero temperature of −25 °C ascribing to the presence of high-concentration charged functional groups and impregnated salts. As a demonstration, a wearable DHB-Fe/CS/PAA ionic sensor in a resistive mode is assembled, demonstrating high sensitivity, wide response range and excellent cyclability in detecting and distinguishing complex human motions rapidly and in real-time.},

Abstract = {This study presents prediction of crack propagation in polycrystalline materials under cyclic loads using Peridynamic (PD) theory. The PD fatigue model utilizes the strain-load cycle (ε-N) data and introduces the “remaining life” of each bond calculated from its cyclic strain, which changes over time. The model also captures the traditional Paris law, which is widely used for computing the fatigue crack growth. Moreover, a new crack tip detection algorithm is introduced to adaptively detect the crack tip which is necessary for the PD fatigue model. Finally, several numerical cases are considered to investigate the effect of the strength of grain boundaries and the size of grains on the fatigue behaviour of polycrystalline materials.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of modern social science and technology, the pace of life is getting faster, and brain fatigue has become a sub-health state that seriously affects the normal life of people. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals reflect changes in the central nervous system. Using EEG signals to assess mental fatigue is a research hotspot in related fields. Most existing fatigue detection methods are time-consuming or don’t achieve satisfactory results due to insufficient features extracted from EEG signals. In this paper, a 2-back task is designed to induce fatigue. The weight value of each channel under a single feature is calculated by ReliefF algorithm. The classification accuracy of each channel under the corresponding features is analyzed. The classification accuracy of each single channel is combined to perform weighted summation to obtain the weight value of each channel. The first half channels sorted in descending order based on the weight value is chosen as the common channels. Multi-features in frequency and time domains are extracted from the common channel data, and the sparse representation method is used to perform feature fusion to obtain sparse fused features. Finally, the SRDA classifier is used to detect the fatigue state. Experimental results show that the proposed methods in our work effectively reduce the number of channels for computation and also improve the mental fatigue detection accuracy.},

Abstract = {Background Mental fatigue is one of the most causes of road accidents. Identification of biological tools and methods such as electroencephalogram (EEG) are invaluable to detect them at early stage in hazard situations., Results The designed technique can classify trials with 98.1% accuracy. The most significant contributions to the selected features are the wavelet coefficients details 1−2 (corresponding to the Beta and Gamma frequency bands) in the central and temporal regions. In this paper, a new algorithm for channel selection is introduced that has been able to achieve 97.2% efficiency by selecting eight channels from 30 recorded channels., Conclusion The obtained results from the classification are compared with other methods, and it is proved that the proposed method accuracy is higher from others at a significant level. The technique is completely automatic, while the calculation load could be reduced remarkably through selecting the optimal channels implementing in real-time.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed a low-cost solution for driver fatigue detection based on micro-sleep patterns. Contrary to conventional methods, we acquired images by placing a camera on the extreme left side of the driver and proposed two algorithms that facilitate accurate face and eye detections, even when the driver is not facing the camera or driver's eyes are closed. The classification to find whether eye is closed or open is done on the right eye only using SVM and Adaboost. Based on eye states, micro-sleep patterns are determined and an alarm is triggered to warn the driver, when needed. In our dataset, we considered multiple subjects from both genders, having different appearances and under different lightning conditions. The proposed scheme gives 99.9% and 98.7% accurate results for face and eye detection, respectively. For all the subjects, the average accuracy of SVM and Adaboost is 96.5% and 95.4%, respectively.

Abstract = {Digital image correlation is utilized to detect automatically crack density in glass/epoxy laminates with different lay-ups under quasi-static and fatigue loading conditions. The DIC setups used in the present work are 2D-DIC and 3D-DIC which are considered to be at meso-scale and macro-scale, respectively. The main objective of this work is to study whether the DIC technique is reliable in automatic crack detection and functional in calculation of crack density. Therefore, an optimization analysis is implemented to evaluate the resolution and the standard uncertainty in strain and displacement measurements. An optimized compromise is attained between the resolution and the uncertainty of both measurements to decide about the final configuration of the DIC setup. The setup is executed by acquiring in-situ images under quasi-static and fatigue experiments so that the images are synchronized with the data acquired from the testing machine. The crack detection analysis is attained by DIC analysis using strain and displacement fields in order to obtain optimum results. Then a semi-automatic program is created to evaluate the crack density and weighted crack density from the edge and top of the specimen, respectively. Moreover, a comparison is established between both strain and displacement fields in crack characterization. Consequently, the displacement field has proved to deliver better and more accurate results than strain fields in crack density calculation and individual crack characterization. Accordingly, the results obtained from DIC analysis are compared and validated by microscopic images which are acquired after performing each test.},

Abstract = {Stringer-to-floor beam connections were reported as one of the most fatigue-prone details in riveted steel railway bridges. To detect stiffness degradation that results from the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks, an automated damage detection framework was proposed by the authors (Eftekhar Azam et al., 2019; Rageh et al., 2018). The proposed method relies on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify damage location and intensity under non-stationary, unknown train loads. Bridge computational models were used to simulate damage scenarios and for training the ANNs. Damage detection method efficiency and accuracy were shown to be significantly influenced by the level of modeling uncertainties (MUs). To investigate the applicability of the proposed framework to in-service bridges, a systematic analysis of the effect of MUs on the proposed POD-ANN framework was necessary. MU influence on the performance of the POD-ANN damage detection method was investigated and a new procedure for generating training data for ANNs was proposed. The procedure was based on synergizing Proper Orthogonal Modes (POMs) extracted from measured structural response and POMs calculated from the numerical model. The current study integrated numerical and field investigations. The main objective of the numerical investigation was to identify a robust damage feature independent of the level and location of assumed MUs. Results showed that Damage Location (DL) and Damage Intensity (DI) were detected with high accuracy for studied uncertainty cases; however, as expected, damage detection accuracy reduced as MU increased. A hybrid experimental-numerical approach was then implemented for the field investigation studies. This approach applied identified damage features from the numerical investigation to measurements from an in-service railway bridge to produce damage scenarios used to train the framework. MATLAB algorithms were developed that preprocessed field data and eliminated POM variations resulted from loading uncertainties. ANNs were trained and tested using the field strain estimated POMs from the hybrid approach and DL and DI results were obtained for the studied railway bridge under non-stationary, unknown train loads. These results show the promise of the POD-ANN method as a robust, real-time fatigue damage identification tool for steel railway bridges.},

Abstract = {Fatigue driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to fatigue detection systems, which is an important solution for preventing fatigue driving. In order to prevent and reduce fatigue driving, a driver fatigue detection system based on computer vision is proposed. In this system, an improved face detection method is used to detect the driver’s face from the image obtained by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Then, the feature points of the eyes and mouth are located by an ensemble of regression trees. Next, fatigue characteristic parameters are calculated by the improved percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time algorithm. Finally, the state of drivers is evaluated by using a fuzzy neural network. The system can effectively monitor and remind the state of drivers so as to significantly avoid or decrease the occurrence of traffic accidents. The experimental results show that the system is of wonderful rea)},

Abstract = {The detection of fatigue cracks has gained widespread attention as it affects the safety of daily lives. Many crack detection methods have been developed up to now and perform well. However, there are still some problems left. It is hard to check the huge objects (such as bridge, building) by using vibration or ultrasonic sensor. Especially the inspection of bridges needs human inspectors. It is high cost, difficult access and dangerous. Vision based fatigue crack detection is considered as a good solution as the system can be carried by a drone and overcomes the above problem. In this study, FAST, ORB, SIFT and SURF features are employed to detect the fatigue cracks by feature matching and this study compares their performance. The experimental results show that ORB based feature matching gives the best result and it is an effective method to detect the fatigue crack.},

Abstract = {Coatings have been used extensively to extend the service life of components. During their service process, fatigue crack may initiate and propagate along the interface between coating and substrate. In order to evaluate the interfacial crack properly by magnetic nondestructive testing, the concept of cohesive zone and the phenomenon of spontaneous magnetization are introduced, and the fatigue cohesive zone-magnetomechanical coupling model is established. The interfacial crack initiation time and propagation behavior can then be predicted, and a new magnetic characteristic indicator dHmax/dN is further proposed to characterize the crack propagation rate. In the case of three point bending fatigue loads with the maximum amplitude at 0.25 mm, calculation results show that crack initiation occurs when the loading cycle number reaches 354, and the corresponding magnetic field intensity increases to the threshold Hmax = 238.1A/m. Furthermore, the magnetic field accumulation rate dHmax/dN is linearly related to the crack propagation rate at the fatigue crack stable propagation stage. In order to verify the theoretical model, the magnetic signals along interface are collected and analyzed under three point bending fatigue test. It indicates that the experimental result is consistent with the theoretical calculation, and the established model can support magnetic nondestructive testing of coatings.},

This has increased the need for driver fatigue detection mechanism in the vehicles to reduce human and vehicle loss during accidents. In the proposed scheme, we capture videos from a camera mounted inside the vehicle. From the captured video, we localize the eyes using Viola-Jones algorithm. Once the eyes have been localized, they are classified as open or closed using three different techniques namely mean intensity, SVM, and SIFT. If eyes are found closed for a considerable amount of time, it indicates fatigue and consequently an alarm is generated to alert the driver. Our experiments show that SIFT outperforms both mean intensity and SVM, achieving an average accuracy of 97.45% on a dataset of five videos, each having a length of two minutes.},

Abstract = {The blades of steam turbines are exposed to low cycle fatigue, as well as to strain cycling fatigue, which may cause their structural deterioration after a low number of cycles. This represents the blade damage in steady condition of operation, which may lead to failure. In this work, the blades of the last stage (L-0) from a 110 MW output steam turbine were analyzed. Samples of material AISI 410 were investigated to define the number of cycles against the stress to failure. As a result, the magnitude of the constants of a numerical model were obtained. In addition, numerical and analytical models predicted the blade damage based on mean stress correction, Strain-life, Morrow and Smith Watson Topper (SWT). The results showed that centrifugal load caused damage in blades and likely, it transforms into crack initiation due to low cycles fatigue. Steam load produced stresses low level in magnitude. However these can be dangerous for blade structure subject to non-linear and resonance conditions, which mainly occur during transient periods. Important differences in prediction of life estimation upon the method emerged for high levels of stress magnitude, which should be taken into account during blade design.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of modern social science and technology, the pace of life is getting faster, and brain fatigue has become a sub-health state that seriously affects the normal life of people. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals reflect changes in the central nervous system. Using EEG signals to assess mental fatigue is a research hotspot in related fields. Most existing fatigue detection methods are time-consuming or don't achieve satisfactory results due to insufficient features extracted from EEG signals. In this paper, a 2-back task is designed to induce fatigue. The weight value of each channel under a single feature is calculated by ReliefF algorithm. The classification accuracy of each channel under the corresponding features is analyzed. The classification accuracy of each single channel is combined to perform weighted summation to obtain the weight value of each channel. The first half channels sorted in descending order based on the weight value is chosen as the common channels. Multi-features in frequency and time domains are extracted from the common channel data, and the sparse representation method is used to perform feature fusion to obtain sparse fused features. Finally, the SRDA classifier is used to detect the fatigue state. Experimental results show that the proposed methods in our work effectively reduce the number of channels for computation and also improve the mental fatigue detection accuracy.},

Abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG)-based driving fatigue detection has gained increasing attention recently due to the non-invasive, low-cost, and potable nature of the EEG technology, but it is still challenging to extract informative features from noisy EEG signals for driving fatigue detection. Radial basis function (RBF) neural network has drawn lots of attention as a promising classifier due to its linear-in-the-parameters network structure, strong non-linear approximation ability, and desired generalization property. The RBF network performance heavily relies on network parameters such as the number of the hidden nodes, number of the center vectors, width, and output weights. However, global optimization methods that directly optimize all the network parameters often result in high evaluation cost and slow convergence. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of EEG-based driving fatigue detection model, this study aims to develop a two-level learning hierarchy RBF network (RBF-TLLH) which allows for global optimization of the key network parameters. Experimental EEG data were collected, at both fatigue and alert states, from six healthy participants in a simulated driving environment. Principal component analysis was first utilized to extract features from EEG signals, and the proposed RBF-TLLH was then employed for driving status (fatigue vs . alert) classification. The results demonstrated that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach achieved a better classification performance (mean accuracy: 92.71%; area under the receiver operating curve: 0.9199) compared to other widely used artificial neural networks. Moreover, only three core parameters need to be determined using the training datasets in the proposed RBF-TLLH classifier, which increases its reliability and applicability. The findings demonstrate that the proposed RBF-TLLH approach can be used as a promising framework for reliable EEG-based driving fatigue detection.

Abstract = {Over the years, traditional active infrared thermography has played a pivotal role in ensuring that a component is free of any damage. However, whilst optical thermography is still not sufficiently sensitive to the presence of material micro-flaws, current vibro-thermography requires inspection solutions that are not always feasible, such as the use of coupling materials between the sensing probe and the monitored structure. This paper presents a valid alternative to current thermographic systems by developing and experimentally validating nonlinear air-coupled thermosonics for a contactless, rapid and accurate detection of fatigue micro-cracks in an aero-engine turbine blade. The proposed thermographic method combines the high sensitivity to micro-damage of nonlinear ultrasonic techniques with non-contact air-coupled ultrasonic transducers and thermographic equipment. Narrowband frequency sweeps were performed to identify local damage resonance frequencies in order to generate large vibrational amplitudes at the damage location and compensate for signal losses caused by the high acoustic impedance mismatch between the air and the sample. An infrared camera was then used to acquire the thermal response generated by frictional heat at the crack interfaces. Moreover, an image processing method based on a combination of morphological opening and a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter was employed to enhance the quality of thermal images affected by anisotropic heating and thermal noise effects. Nonlinear air-coupled thermosonics experiments were validated with laser Doppler vibrometry scan measurements and compared with both flash and pulsed phase thermography. Thermal imaging results showed that the proposed nonlinear air-coupled thermosonics was the only thermographic technique able to detect fatigue micro-cracks, thus demonstrating its potential as an efficient and sensitive inspection tool for micro-damage detection in geometrically complex components.},

Abstract = {Fatigue in selective laser melted (SLM) and conventionally manufactured stainless steel (SS) 316 dogbones was studied with neutron imaging methods for attenuation, diffraction, and scattering. Neutron attenuation tomography and Bragg edge imaging did not reveal crack formation. Conversely, to efficiently detect the microcrack evolution, two methods of grating-based neutron interferometry, Talbot-Lau and far-field, were employed. Both interferometry methods detect early crack formation via the dark-field (scattering) images, especially for porous microstructures in the range of 0.6μm to 2μm. The dark-field image combines sensitivity to micrometer-sized scattering centers at crack formation with sub-millimeter imaging resolution. The crack formation observed with neutron interferometry dark-field was validated post-imaging with additional fatigue cycles to fracture. Further inspection was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical photography. In the two fatigued dogbonM},

Abstract = {This research reports a selective detecting and focusing approach for fatigue cracks through use of decomposition of the time reversal operator (DORT) in combination with nonlinear Lamb waves. In the proposed approach, the time reversal operator (TRO) is only decomposed at the second-harmonic frequency, which has been widely utilized in recent years to evaluate micro-damage, rather than the fundamental frequency in the traditional DORT method. Further, an imaging algorithm based on the total focus method is introduced to locate nonlinear scatterers. The proposed approach is experimentally investigated to locate two fatigue cracks with different fatigue cycles in an aluminum plate with a set of surface bounded piezoelectric (PZT) transducers. The results show that the significant eigenvalues are related to the fatigue cycles of fatigue cracks when the TRO is decomposed at the second-harmonic frequency, and the number of significant eigenvalues is exactly equal to the number of fatigue cracks. The two fatigue cracks are selectively located accurately and are also distinguished from linear scatterer by use of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {In this paper the elastic wave propagation phenomenon was used to detect the initiation of the fatigue damage in isotropic plate with a circular hole. The safety and reliability of structures mostly depend on the effectiveness of the monitoring methods. The Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system based on the active pitch-catch measurement technique was proposed. The piezoelectric (PZT) elements was used as an actuators and sensors in the multipoint measuring system. The comparison of the intact and defected structures has been used by damage detection algorithm. One part of the SHM system has been responsible for detection of the fatigue crack initiation. The second part observed the evolution of the damage growth and assess the size of the defect. The numerical results of the wave propagation phenomenon has been used to present the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method. The preliminary experimental analysis has been carried out during the tension test of the aluminum plate with a circular hole to determine the efficiency of the measurement technique.},

Abstract = {The study of the robust fatigue feature learning method for the driver’s operational behavior is of great significance for improving the performance of the real-time detection system for driver’s fatigue state. Aiming at how to extract more abstract and deep features in the driver’s direction operation data in the robust feature learning, this article constructs a fuzzy recurrent neural network model, which includes input layer, fuzzy layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The steering-wheel direction sensing time series sends the time series to the input layer through a fixed time window. After the fuzzification process, it is sent to the hidden layer to share the weight of the hidden layer, realize the memorization of the fatigue feature, and improve the feature depth capability of the steering wheel angle time sequence. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an average recognition rate of 87.30% in the fatigue sample database of real vehicle conditions, which indicates that the model has strong robustness to different subjects under real driving conditions. The model proposed in this article has important theoretical and engineering significance for studying the prediction of fatigue driving under real driving conditions.},

Abstract = {This study presents an artificial intelligence approach for the detection of distortion-induced fatigue cracking of steel bridge girders based on the data provided by self-powered wireless sensors. The sensors have a series of memory gates that can cumulatively record the duration of the applied strain. The gates are activated as soon as the electrical charge generated by piezoelectric strain transducer exceeds pre-defined thresholds. In the present study, the distribution of the sensor output has been characterized by a Gaussian cumulative density function. For the analysis, extensive finite element simulations were carried out to obtain the structural response of an existing highway steel bridge girder (I-96/M-52) in Webberville, Michigan. Different damage states were defined by extending the lengths of the crack at the web gaps from 10mm to 100mm. Damage indicator features were extracted for different data acquisition nodes based on the sensor output distribution. Subsequently, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were developed to fuse the clustered features and identify multiple damage states. The results indicate that the models have acceptable detection performance, specifically for cracks larger than 10mm. The best classification performance was obtained using the information from a group of sensors located near the damage zone.},

In this study, the feasibility of thermography for on-line detection of micro-cracks in a closed contact during fretting fatigue experiments is investigated. Temperature variations in four regions of interest at the specimen surface are recorded and processed on-line based on a lock-in methodology to extract the first harmonic temperature amplitude. Following running-in and stabilization stages, the initiation of cracks leads to a rise of the stabilized first harmonic temperature amplitude for the specific region of interest where cracks are located.

Abstract = {In the world of rail travel, unplanned track maintenance constitutes disruption and negatively impacts customer satisfaction. To maintain railway networks it is necessary to plan maintenance before it becomes critical, preferably by at least a year. A major concern in railway quality is the occurrence of micro-cracks in railhead surfaces, due to rolling contact fatigue. When these cracks are superficial, no more than about a millimeter in depth, the railhead lifetime can be increased by grinding or polishing. However, the deeper the cracks are, the sooner they will grow beyond a depth that can be managed by polishing. Current inspection techniques are able to detect millimeter sized cracks, but no smaller. We present a new technique for the detection of cracks in railheads, which is able to detect cracks of 20–100µm depth optically, by way of broadband, spatially incoherent optical coherence tomography. Detection of micro-cracks at an earlier stage of development and the study of their progression will aid in advance planning and scheduling of maintenance.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of the automotive industry has brought great convenience to our life, which also leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of traffic accidents. A large proportion of traffic accidents were caused by driving fatigue. EEG is considered as a direct, effective, and promising modality to detect driving fatigue. In this study, we presented a novel feature extraction strategy based on a deep learning model to achieve high classification accuracy and efficiency in using EEG for driving fatigue detection. EEG signals were recorded from six healthy volunteers in a simulated driving experiment. The feature extraction strategy was developed by integrating the principal component analysis (PCA) and a deep learning model called PCA network (PCANet). In particular, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to preprocess EEG data to reduce its dimension in order to overcome the limitation of dimension explosion caused by PCANet, making this approach feasible for EEG-base)},

Abstract = {Identifying growing cracks in running machinery and industrial facilities is challenging, particularly at the nucleation stage in “hard-to-reach” places and in harsh environment. The method of acoustic emission is a popular non-destructive means for inspecting and monitoring the behavior of loaded materials and active internal defects. One of the key problems which impedes a wider application of the AE technique is associated with detectability of low amplitude signals hidden on a background of laboratory or industrial noise. A recently proposed continuous threshold-less mode of AE data acquisition offers an advantage in analyzing AE random time series on different time scales, thus providing information otherwise inaccessible by a conventional threshold-based acquisition mode. The evaluation criteria concerning the activity of internal defects depend strongly on the AE detectability in the selected time interval. In the present work we compare performance of two signal detection algorithms: conventional amplitude threshold discrimination and innovative «phase picker» based on a wavelet transform. In observing the characteristic accumulation of AE signals over long periods of hundreds time and opposite in a single loading cycle can provide a difference at signal estimation.},

Abstract = {Development of fatigue cracking is affecting the structural performance of many of welded steel bridges in the United States. One of the main sources of fatigue cracking is out-of-plane distortion occurring at connections of transverse structural members and longitudinal girders. Distortion-induced fatigue cracks mostly occur in older bridges with members prone to fatigue. Prediction of secondary stresses in these members is difficult using conventional design specifications. This limitation suggests the necessity of utilizing new strategies to analyze the damage caused by distortion-related cracking. This study presents a new approach for detection of distortion-induced fatigue cracking of steel bridges based on the interpretation of the data provided by a newly developed self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) sensor. The PFG sensors are empowered using piezoelectric transducers through harvesting energy from the mechanical loading experienced by the structure. In order to assess the performance of the proposed sensing system, three-dimensional finite element models were developed and the structural response of the girder was subsequently obtained. The fatigue life of the girder was determined based on J-integral concept and Paris Law. Several damage states were defined by extending the fatigue crack lengths. Thereafter, features representing the PFG sensor output were extracted from the strain data for different sensing nodes to detect the damage scenarios. Furthermore, a new data fusion concept based on the effect of group of sensors was proposed to improve the damage detection performance. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of detecting different damage progression states. This is specifically evident for the sensors that are located close to the damage location. The acceptable performance of the proposed sensing system implies its applicability for other modalities of infrastructure/structural health monitoring (I/SHM).},

Abstract = {Road traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving are common causes of human casualties. In this paper, we present a driver fatigue detection algorithm using two-stream network models with multi-facial features. The algorithm consists of four parts: (1) Positioning mouth and eye with multi-task cascaded convolutional neural networks (MTCNNs). (2) Extracting the static features from a partial facial image. (3) Extracting the dynamic features from a partial facial optical flow. (4) Combining both static and dynamic features using a two-stream neural network to make the classification. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of a two-stream network and multi-facial features for driver fatigue detection. Two-stream networks can combine static and dynamic image information, while partial facial images as network inputs can focus on fatigue-related information, which brings better performance. Moreover, we applied gamma correction to enhance image contrast, which can help our method achieve better results, noted by an increased accuracy of 2% in night environments. Finally, an accuracy of 97.06% was achieved on the National Tsing Hua University Driver Drowsiness Detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset.},

Abstract = {Current sign-in methods of patrolling security guards mainly comprise signature, image identification, and fingerprint identification; notably, none of these methods indicate the physical and mental conditions of such guards. In particular, when patrolling security guards perform their duties consecutively for a long period of time, adequate attention should be directed toward their levels of mental fatigue. When a handwriting sign-in system is adopted, security guards may not record their sign-in time accurately, or they may fake signatures during long shifts. In addition, image identification systems cannot comprehensively reflect the physical and mental statuses of on-duty security guards, particularly their levels of fatigue. Monitor fatigue in patrolling security guards is important to avoid burnout and stress in the workplace. Therefore, in this study, a patrolling sign-in system that integrates physiological signals and images was designed. A thermometer, hand dynamometer, and electromyography sensor were combined to measure physiological signals. Results showed that hand grip strength and the median frequency of electromyography signals gradually reduced when muscle fatigue occurred. The system determined whether a security guard had signed in punctually and whether this person should stay on duty. Overall, this system was verified to operate effectively, and it is therefore applicable for monitoring the sign-in of patrolling security guards who work long shifts. This case series study proposed a conceptual prototype of the system; large-scale testing should be performed in subsequent research.},

Abstract = {Driver fatigue is an important factor in traffic accidents, and the development of a detection system for driver fatigue is of great significance. To estimate and prevent driver fatigue, various classifiers based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been developed; however, as EEG signals have inherent non-stationary characteristics, their detection performance is often deteriorated by background noise. To investigate the effects of noise on detection performance, simulated Gaussian noise, spike noise, and electromyogram (EMG) noise were added into a raw EEG signal. Four types of entropies, including sample entropy (SE), fuzzy entropy (FE), approximate entropy (AE), and spectral entropy (PE), were deployed for feature sets. Three base classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT)) and two ensemble methods (Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) and Boosting) were employed and compared. Results showed that: (1) the simulated Gaussian noise )},

Abstract = {The article deals with the testing of features for fatigue detection in electrooculography (EOG) records. An optimal methodology for EOG signal acquisition is described; the Biopac data acquisition system was used. EOG signals were being recorded while 10 volunteers were watching prepared scenes. Three scenes were created for this purpose - a rotating ball, a video of driving a car, and a cross. Recorded EOG signals were processed and 20 features were extracted. The features involved blinks, slow eye movement (SEM), rapid eye movement (REM), eye instability, magnitude, and periodicity. These features were statistically tested and discussed in terms of fatigue detection ability. Some of the features were compared with published results. Finally, the best features - fatigue indicators - were selected.

Abstract = {Abstract Fatigue driving is the main reason of traffic accidents. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal can accurately reflect the changes of human physiological state, so EEG is considered as a reliable method to detect fatigue driving. In this letter, the Euclidean space data alignment approach is adopted to reduce individual differences. Then, to consider the spatial correlation between multiple channels EEG signals and further improve the accuracy, an efficient long short‐term memory (LSTM) network structure is designed to detect the fatigue state of drivers. The experimental result shows that the method improves the generalisation capability and achieves the performance with an average accuracy of 95.70% for three categories. Evaluation of the algorithm performance in comparison with other traditional methods indicates that the method has higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. Generally speaking, the proposed method is promising for the application of fatigue driving monitoring.},

Abstract = {Abstract Eyes opening and closing status is one of the most important components to monitor the driver's fatigue.d The current research mainly considers eyes blink frequency and the closing duration to judge the driver's fatigue. To identify driver's fatigue level, eyes opening and closing ratio (EOCR) is a critical factor and therefore, it is desirable to detect EOCR for driver's fatigue monitoring. The proposed method aims to simultaneously segment images and measure the parameters of the EOCR. A BiSeNet‐based iris and pupil segmentation network is first proposed and the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) ConvNet‐based model to detect the EOCR value is provided by considering the main features rounding eyes area and the iris‐pupil size for building test dataset. The comparison experiments are conducted with the proposed method and the other existing work in different datasets, such as CASIA‐Iris‐Thousand, CASIA‐Iris‐Interval, and UBIRIS.v2. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has superior detection effects on both infrared images and colour images than other existing approaches. Furthermore, the experiments of detecting the EOCR and iris and pupil segmentation are carried out with the test dataset and the results show that the proposed method can reliably identify driver's eye opening and closing degree.},

Abstract = {Most current vision-based fatigue detection methods don't have high-performance and robust face detector. They detect driver fatigue using single detection feature and cannot achieve real-time efficiency on edge computing devices. Aimed at solving these problems, this paper proposes a driver fatigue detection system based on convolutional neural network that can run in real-time on edge computing devices. The system firstly uses the proposed face detection network LittleFace to locate the face and classify the face into two states: small yaw angle state "normal" and large yaw angle state "distract." Secondly, the speed-optimized SDM algorithm is conducted only in the face region of the "normal" state to deal with the problem that the face alignment accuracy decreases at large angle profile, and the "distract" state is used to detect driver distraction. Finally, feature parameters EAR, MAR and head pitch angle are calculated from the obtained landmarks and used to detect driver fatigue)},

Abstract = {Background: The detection of driver fatigue as a cause of sleepiness is a key technology capable of preventing fatal accidents. This research uses a fatigue-related sleepiness detection algorithm based on the analysis of the pulse rate variability generated by the heartbeat and validates the proposed method by comparing it with an objective indicator of sleepiness (PERCLOS). Methods: changes in alert conditions affect the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and therefore heart rate variability (HRV), modulated in the form of a wave and monitored to detect long-term changes in the driver’s condition using real-time control. Results: the performance of the algorithm was evaluated through an experiment carried out in a road vehicle. In this experiment, data was recorded by three participants during different driving sessions and their conditions of fatigue and sleepiness were documented on both a subjective and objective basis. The validation of the results through PERCLOS showed a 63% adherence to the experimental findings. Conclusions: the present study confirms the possibility of continuously monitoring the driver’s status through the detection of the activation/deactivation states of the ANS based on HRV. The proposed method can help prevent accidents caused by drowsiness while driving.},

To address this problem, we, in this work, develop a novel Multiplex Limited Penetrable Horizontal Visibility Graph (Multiplex LPHVG) method, which allows in not only detecting fatigue driving but also probing into the brain fatigue behavior. Importantly, we use the method to construct brain networks from EEG signals recorded from different subjects performing simulated driving tasks under alert and fatigue driving states. We then employ clustering coefficient, global efficiency and characteristic path length to characterize the topological structure of the networks generated from different brain states. In addition, we combine average edge overlap with the network measures to distinguish alert and mental fatigue states. The high-accurate classification results clearly demonstrate and validate the efficacy of our multiplex LPHVG method for the fatigue detection from EEG signals. Furthermore, our findings show a significant increase of the clustering coefficient as the brain evolves from alert state to mental fatigue state, which yields novel insights into the brain behavior associated with fatigue driving.},

Abstract = {To examine the correlation of driver visual behaviors and subjective levels of fatigue, a total of 36 commercial drivers were invited to participate in 2-h, 3-h, and 4-h naturalistic driving tests during which their eye fixation, saccade, blinking variables, and self-awareness of their fatigue levels were recorded. Then, one-way ANOVA was applied to analyze the variations of each variable among different age groups over varying time periods. The statistical analysis revealed that driving duration had a significant effect on the variation of visual behaviors and feelings of fatigue. After 2h of driving, only the average closure duration value and subjective level of fatigue had an increase of one-fifth or more. After 4h of driving, however, all these variables had a significant change except for the number of saccades and pupil diameter measurements. Particularly, driver saccadic eye movement was more sensitive to driving fatigue, and the elderly were more likely to be affected by the duration of the drive. Finally, a predictor of driver fatigue was determined to detect the real-time level of fatigue and alert at the critical moment.},

Abstract = {Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) benefit from muscle training with functional electrical stimulation (FES). For safety reasons and to optimize training outcome, the fatigue state of the target muscle must be monitored. Detection of muscle fatigue from mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature of mechanomyographic (MMG) signal using support vector machine (SVM) classifier is a promising new approach. Five individuals with SCI performed FES cycling exercises for 30 min. MMG signals were recorded on the quadriceps muscle group (rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM)) and categorized into non-fatigued and fatigued muscle contractions for the first and last 10 min of the cycling session. For each subject, a total of 1800 contraction-related MMG signals were used to train the SVM classifier and another 300 signals were used for testing. The average classification accuracy (4-fold) of non-fatigued and fatigued state was 90.7% using MFCC feature, 74.5% using root mean square (RMS), and 88.8% with combined MFCC and RMS features. Inter-subject prediction accuracy suggested training and testing data to be based on a particular subject or large collection of subjects to improve fatigue prediction capacity.

Abstract = {Purpose: Driving fatigue has become one of the important causes of road accidents, there are many researches to analyze driver fatigue. EEG is becoming increasingly useful in the measuring fatigue state. Manual interpretation of EEG signals is impossible, so an effective method for automatic detection of EEG signals is crucial needed.Method: In order to evaluate the complex, unstable, and non-linear characteristics of EEG signals, four feature sets were computed from EEG signals, in which fuzzy entropy (FE), sample entropy (SE), approximate Entropy (AE), spectral entropy (PE), and combined entropies (FE + SE + AE + PE) were included. All these feature sets were used as the input vectors of AdaBoost classifier, a boosting method which is fast and highly accurate. To assess our method, several experiments including parameter setting and classifier comparison were conducted on 28 subjects. For comparison, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers are used.Results: The proposed method (combination of FE and AdaBoost) yields superior performance than other schemes. Using FE feature extractor, AdaBoost achieves improved area (AUC) under the receiver operating curve of 0.994, error rate (ERR) of 0.024, Precision of 0.969, Recall of 0.984, F1 score of 0.976, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.952, compared to SVM (ERR at 0.035, Precision of 0.957, Recall of 0.974, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.930 with AUC of 0.990), DT (ERR at 0.142, Precision of 0.857, Recall of 0.859, F1 score of 0.966, and MCC of 0.716 with AUC of 0.916) and NB (ERR at 0.405, Precision of 0.646, Recall of 0.434, F1 score of 0.519, and MCC of 0.203 with AUC of 0.606). It shows that the FE feature set and combined feature set outperform other feature sets. AdaBoost seems to have better robustness against changes of ratio of test samples for all samples and number of subjects, which might therefore aid in the real-time detection of driver fatigue through the classification of EEG signals.Conclusion: By using combination of FE features and AdaBoost classifier to detect EEG-based driver fatigue, this paper ensured confidence in exploring the inherent physiological mechanisms and wearable application.},

Abstract = {In present work, the heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics, calculated by sample entropy (SampEn), were used to analyze the driving fatigue state at successive driving stages. Combined with the relative power spectrum ratio β/(θ + α), subjective questionnaire, and brain network parameters of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the relationships between the different characteristics for driving fatigue were discussed. Thus, it can conclude that the HRV characteristics (RR SampEn and R peaks SampEn), as well as the relative power spectrum ratio β/(θ + α) of the channels (C3, C4, P3, P4), the subjective questionnaire, and the brain network parameters, can effectively detect driving fatigue at various driving stages. In addition, the method for collecting ECG signals from the palm part does not need patch electrodes, is convenient, and will be practical to use in actual driving situations in the future.},

Abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are commonly used for detecting Lamb waves for structural health monitoring application. However, in most applications of active sensing, the signals are of high-amplitude and easy to detect. In this article, we have shown a new avenue of using the PWAS transducer for detecting the low-amplitude fatigue-crack related acoustic emission (AE) signals. Multiphysics finite element (FE) simulations were performed with two PWAS transducers bonded to the structure. Various configurations of the sensors were studied by using the simulations. One PWAS was placed near to the fatigue-crack and the other one was placed at a certain distance from the crack. The simulated AE event was generated at the crack tip. The simulation results showed that both PWAS transducers were capable of sensing the AE signals. To validate the multiphysics simulation results, an in-situ AE-fatigue experiment was performed. Two PWAS transducers were bonded to the thin aerospace test coupon. The fatigue crack was generated in the test coupon which had produced low-amplitude acoustic waves. The low-amplitude fatigue-crack related AE signals were successfully captured by the PWAS transducers. The distance effect on the captured AE signals was also studied. It has been shown that some high-frequency contents of the AE signal have developed as they travel away from the crack.},

Abstract = {In recent years, fatigue driving has been a serious threat to the traffic safety, which makes the research of fatigue detection a hotspot field. Research on fatigue recognition has a great significance to improve the traffic safety. However, the existing fatigue detection methods still have room for improvement in detection accuracy and efficiency. In order to detect whether the driver has fatigue driving, this paper proposes a fatigue state recognition algorithm. The method first uses MTCNN (multitask convolutional neural network) to detect human face, and then DLIB (an open-source software library) is used to locate facial key points to extract the fatigue feature vector of each frame. The fatigue feature vectors of multiple frames are spliced into a temporal feature sequence and sent to the LSTM (long short-term memory) network to obtain a final fatigue feature value. Experiments show that compared with other methods, the fatigue state recognition algorithm proposed in this paper h)},

Second, phase space reconstruction was conducted for extracting chaotic features of the measured electrocardial signals. The phase diagrams show fractal geometry features even under a strong noise background. Finally, Kolmogorov entropy, which is a factor reflecting the uncertainty in and the chaotic level of a nonlinear dynamic system, was used as an indicator of driver fatigue. The effectiveness of Kolmogorov entropy in the judgment of driver fatigue was confirmed by comparison with a semantic differential (SD) subjective evaluation experiment. It was demonstrated that Kolmogorov entropy has a strong relationship with driver fatigue. It decreases when fatigue occurs. Furthermore, the influences of delay time and sampling point)},

Abstract = {Fatigue will affect the normal work and even cause accidents. In order to reduce fatigue's impact on people, we proposes a method for providing a real-time fatigued detection.Specifically, this method comprise the following steps. Firstly of all, we use Active Shape Model (ASM) to detect face, extract the Histogram of Orientation Gradient (HOG) features of eyes and mouth. Secondly, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the states and Pose from Orthography and Scaling with Iterations (POSIT) algorithm to estimate the poses of the head. Thirdly, based on the states of face, we obtain a fatigue decision index, wherein a weight of the fatigue decision index is calculated by the Entropy-weighting method. Finally, we apply Bayesian method to evaluate driver's fatigued level based on calculated fatigue decision index. The final mean accuracy of this method is 83.3%.

Abstract = {The article deals with the testing of features for fatigue detection in electrooculography (EOG) records. An optimal methodology for EOG signal acquisition is described; the Biopac data acquisition system was used. EOG signals were being recorded while 10 volunteers were watching prepared scenes. Three scenes were created for this purpose - a rotating ball, a video of driving a car, and a cross. Recorded EOG signals were processed and 20 features were extracted. The features involved blinks, slow eye movement (SEM), rapid eye movement (REM), eye instability, magnitude, and periodicity. These features were statistically tested and discussed in terms of fatigue detection ability. Some of the features were compared with published results. Finally, the best features - fatigue indicators - were selected.},

Abstract = {A novel application of phase-space warping (PSW) method to detect fatigue in the musculoskeletal system is presented. Experimental kinematic, force, and physiological signals are used to produce a fatigue metric. The metric is produced using time-delay embedding and PSW methods. The results showed that by using force and kinematic signals, an overall estimate of the muscle group state can be achieved. Further, when using electromyography (EMG) signals the fatigue metric can be used as a tool to evaluate muscles activation and load sharing patterns for individual muscles. The presented method will allow for fatigue evolution measurement outside a laboratory environment, which open doors to applications such as tracking the physical state of players during competition, workers in a plant, and patients undergoing in-home rehabilitation.

Abstract = {In this study, an attempt has been made to develop an automated muscle fatigue detection system using cyclostationary based geometric features of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. For this purpose, signals are acquired from fifty-eight healthy volunteers under dynamic muscle fatiguing contractions. The sEMG signals are preprocessed and the epochs of signals under nonfatigue and fatigue conditions are considered for the analysis. A computationally effective Fast Fourier transform based accumulation algorithm is adapted to compute the spectral correlation density coefficients. The boundary of spectral density coefficients in the complex plane is obtained using alpha shape method. The geometric features, namely, perimeter, area, circularity, bending energy, eccentricity and inertia are extracted from the shape and the machine learning models based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and extreme learning machine (ELM) are developed using these biomarkers. The results show that the cyclostationarity increases in fatigue condition. All the extracted features are found to have significant difference in the two conditions. It is found that the ELM model based on prominent features classifies the sEMG signals with a maximum accuracy of 94.09% and F-score of 93.75%. Therefore, the proposed approach appears to be useful for analysing the fatiguing contractions in neuromuscular conditions.},

Abstract = {The construction of wearable piezoresistive sensors with high elasticity, large gauge factor, and excellent durability in a harsh high-temperature environment is highly desired yet challenging. Here, a lightweight, superelastic, and fatigue-resistant spongy conductor was fabricated via a sponge-constrained network assembly, during which highly conductive graphene and flame-retardant montmorillonite were alternatively deposited on a three-dimensional melamine scaffold. The as-obtained spongy conductor exhibited a highly deformation-tolerant conductivity up to 80% strain and excellent fatigue resistance of 10,000 compressive cycles at 70% strain. As a result, the spongy conductor can readily work as a piezoresistive sensor and exhibited a high gauge factor value of ∼2.3 in a strain range of 60-80% and excellent durability under 60% strain for 10,000 cycles without sacrificing its piezoresistive performance. Additionally, the piezoresistive sensor showed great thermal stability up to 250 °C for more than 7 days and sufficient flame-retardant performance for at least 20 s. This lightweight, superelastic, and flame-retardant spongy conductor reveals tremendous potential in human motion detection against a harsh high-temperature environment.},

Abstract = {Background: The detection of driver fatigue as a cause of sleepiness is a key technology capable of preventing fatal accidents. This research uses a fatigue-related sleepiness detection algorithm based on the analysis of the pulse rate variability generated by the heartbeat and validates the proposed method by comparing it with an objective indicator of sleepiness (PERCLOS). Methods : changes in alert conditions affect the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and therefore heart rate variability (HRV), modulated in the form of a wave and monitored to detect long-term changes in the driver's condition using real-time control. Results : the performance of the algorithm was evaluated through an experiment carried out in a road vehicle. In this experiment, data was recorded by three participants during different driving sessions and their conditions of fatigue and sleepiness were documented on both a subjective and objective basis. The validation of the results through PERCLOS showed a 63% adherence to the experimental findings. Conclusions : the present study confirms the possibility of continuously monitoring the driver's status through the detection of the activation/deactivation states of the ANS based on HRV. The proposed method can help prevent accidents caused by drowsiness while driving.},

The landmarks of the driver's face were labeled and the eye-area was segmented. By calculating the aspect ratios of the eyes, the duration of eye closure, frequency of blinks and PERCLOS of both colored and infrared, fatigue can be detected. Based on the change of light intensity detected by a photosensitive device, the weight matrix of the colored features and the infrared features was adjusted adaptively to reduce the impact of lighting on fatigue detection.

This has increased the need for driver fatigue detection mechanism in the vehicles to reduce human and vehicle loss during accidents. In the proposed scheme, we capture videos from a camera mounted inside the vehicle. From the captured video, we localize the eyes using Viola-Jones algorithm. Once the eyes have been localized, they are classified as open or closed using three different techniques namely mean intensity, SVM, and SIFT. If eyes are found closed for a considerable amount of time, it indicates fatigue and consequently an alarm is generated to alert the driver. Our experiments show that SIFT outperforms both mean intensity and SVM, achieving an average accuracy of 97.45% on a dataset of five videos, each having a length of two minutes [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyright of International Journal of Interactive Multimedia & Artificial Intelligence is the property of Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR) and its conte)},

Abstract = { Most of the people who do not take required sleep are prone to sleep-deprived mental fatigue. This mental fatigue due to sleep deprivation is very harmful to persons involved in critical jobs like Pilots, Surgeons, Air traffic controllers and others. The present research paper proposes an intelligent method based on re-enforced learning, followed by classification supported by the adaptive threshold. Moreover, the method proposed by us is non-intrusive, in which the subject is unaware of being monitored during the test; it helps prevent biased results. The novelty lies in the use of the Inter-frame interval of an open and close eye for feature extraction that leads to the detection of “Alertness” or “Fatigue” based on the adaptive threshold. The proposed self-learning framework is real-time in nature and has a detection accuracy of 97.5 %. Since the method is self-learning, as the size of the data set increases, its accuracy and sensitivity are likely to increase further. [ABSTRACT F)},

The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal can accurately reflect the changes of human physiological state, so EEG is considered as a reliable method to detect fatigue driving. In this letter, the Euclidean space data alignment approach is adopted to reduce individual differences. Then, to consider the spatial correlation between multiple channels EEG signals and further improve the accuracy, an efficient long short‐term memory (LSTM) network structure is designed to detect the fatigue state of drivers. The experimental result shows that the method improves the generalisation capability and achieves the performance with an average accuracy of 95.70% for three categories. Evaluation of the algorithm performance in comparison with other traditional methods indicates that the method has higher accuracy and lower standard deviation. Generally speaking, the proposed method is promising for the application of fatigue driving monitoring. [)},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for structural health monitoring of fatigue cracks under stationary random loads. The methodology is composed of two parts: an empirical correlation to monitor the evolution of damage indices and a numerical scheme for fatigue life estimation. The damage indices are based on the variation of the vibrational response of the structure due to crack propagation. Two damage metrics are studied, and the methodology is verified for a cantilever beam subjected to random base excitation. The case study validates the effectiveness of the methodology and shows that both metrics have the potential for damage detection. For the numerical estimation of the fatigue life, the proposed framework uses the probability density function of the stress, which is obtained from frequency‐domain methods, and an equivalent stress approach based on the Walker's equation for fatigue crack growth. Excellent agreement is found between the predicted fatigue life and the experimental)},

Abstract = {The occurrence of fatigue cracks is an inherent part of the design of engineering structures subjected to nonconstant loads. Thus, the accurate description of cracks in terms of location and evolution during service conditions is mandatory to fulfill safety‐relevant criteria. In the present work, we implement a deep convolutional neural network to detect crack paths together with their crack tips based on displacement fields obtained using digital image correlation. To this purpose, fatigue crack propagation experiments were performed for AA2024‐T3 rolled sheets using specimens with different geometries. Several hundred datasets were acquired by digital image correlation during the experiments. A part of the displacement data from one of the specimens was then used to train the neural network. The results show that the method can accurately detect the shape and evolution of the cracks in all specimens. Adding synthetic data generated by finite element analyses to the training step imp)},

Abstract = {Fatigue is one of the common damages in strands for long-term using. Therefore, the detection of fatigue damage in strands is very important to guarantee its reliable operation. In this paper, the feasibility of fatigue damage detection of strands using magnetostrictive guided waves is studied. The coupling efficiency of magnetostrictive guided waves is used to distinguish the fatigue damage of strands. A direct current solenoid magnetizer is used to get the relationship between the strength of bias magnetic field and the peak to peak value of magnetostrictive guided wave signal on fatigue and no fatigue area of a strand. The coupling efficiency of excitation and receiving process of magnetostrictive guided wave is obtained by the relationship.

Abstract = {Summary: This paper presents the development of a fatigue damage detection and growth monitoring technique based on coda wave interferometry (CWI) for composite structures. The time domain distortion (TD) component of coda waves, which is typically ignored as noise in the literature, is used and experimentally validated. First, a widely used signal processing method for CWI called the stretching method is applied, and TD component is extracted in the time domain. Next, threshold values are statistically estimated using noise levels of the signal and compared with the amplitude of TD component for detecting early‐stage fatigue damage. A damage index (DI) is then obtained from TD component and used to monitor fatigue damage growth. The experimental results of the damage detection and growth monitoring are validated through visual inspection during the fatigue test. Finally, the developed technique's performance is evaluated by comparing it to conventional ultrasonic and CWI‐based compos)},

Human inspection is the most commonly applied approach for fatigue crack detection, but is time consuming, labor intensive, and lacks reliability. In this study, we propose a computer vision‐based fatigue crack detection approach using a short video stream taken by a consumer‐grade digital camera. A feature tracking technology is applied to the video for tracking the surface motion of the monitored structure under repetitive load. Then, a crack detection and localization algorithm is established to effectively search differential features at different video frames caused by the crack opening and closing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through testing two experimental specimens with in‐plane and out‐of‐plane fatigue cracks, respectively.

Abstract = {The occurrence and expansion of fatigue cracks in large wind turbine blades may lead to catastrophic blade failure. Each fatigue phase of a material has been associated with a typical set of acoustic emission (AE) signal frequency components, providing a logical base for establishing a clear connection between AE signals and the fatigue condition of a material. The relevance of efforts to relate recorded AE signals to a material's mechanical behaviour relies heavily on accurate AE signal processing. The main objective of the present study is to establish a direct correlation between the fatigue condition of a material and recorded AE signals. We introduce the blind deconvolution separation (BDS) approach because the result of AE monitoring is usually a convoluted mixture of signals from multiple sources. The method is implemented on data acquired from a fatigue test rig employing a wind turbine blade with an artificial transverse crack seeded in the surface at the base of the blade. T)},

Abstract Confounding influences, such as operational and environmental variations, represent a limitation to the implementation of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems in real structures, potentially leading to damage misclassifications. In this framework, this study considers cointegration as a state of the art method for data normalisation in fatigue crack propagation scenarios, where monitoring is performed by a distributed network of strain sensors.

Abstract = {Abstract The paper presents a novel approach to driver's fatigue recognition based on yawn detection using thermal imaging. This work writes into the active drivers' assisting systems which can warn on driver's drowsiness based on continuous observations. The method can operate in day and night conditions without distracting a driver due to usage of thermal images. At first, face alignment is done by detection of eye corners. Then, yawns are detected based on the proposed yawning thermal model. For quantitative evaluation an annotated image database was created which has been made publicly accessible. Experiments were performed in laboratory, as well as in real car conditions, showing high efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract = {Abstract The blades of steam turbines are exposed to low cycle fatigue, as well as to strain cycling fatigue, which may cause their structural deterioration after a low number of cycles. This represents the blade damage in steady condition of operation, which may lead to failure. In this work, the blades of the last stage (L-0) from a 110 MW output steam turbine were analyzed. Samples of material AISI 410 were investigated to define the number of cycles against the stress to failure. As a result, the magnitude of the constants of a numerical model were obtained. In addition, numerical and analytical models predicted the blade damage based on mean stress correction, Strain-life, Morrow and Smith Watson Topper (SWT). The results showed that centrifugal load caused damage in blades and likely, it transforms into crack initiation due to low cycles fatigue. Steam load produced stresses low level in magnitude. However these can be dangerous for blade structure subject to non-linear and reso)},

Two pulse lasers are shot on the target specimen for ultrasonic generation. The corresponding ultrasonic responses are measured by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) and analyzed to extract the crack induced nonlinear ultrasonic modulation. First, the effect of the pulse laser beam size on the frequency content of the generated ultrasonic waves is numerically and experimentally investigated. Then, this finding of the laser beam size effect is utilized to generate wideband (WB) and narrowband (NB) ultrasonic waves by adjusting the laser beam sizes of the two pulsed excitation lasers. Nonlinear ultrasonic modulation results from the interaction of WB and NB ultrasonic waves when a fatigue crack exists in the target specimen. The fatigue crack is then detected by comparing the spectral responses obtained under a single WB input and both WB and NB inputs. In the)},

Abstract = {To avoid the sudden failure of mechanical structures under repeated loading and to supplement conventional methods of managing life time, we propose a failure detection technique under random fatigue loading using machine learning and dual sensing on a symmetric structure. The state of a shackle, which is used to connect the cargo to the hoist efficiently, under fatigue loading was collected using two strain sensors of a dual system. The strains were preprocessed and labeled as normal or abnormal. Logistic regression machine learning was employed to determine the decision boundary line. Then, we gathered the decision boundary lines of each experiment for determining the time of failure, and we verified every experiment with the most conservative decision boundary line. The results indicate that failure was detected before the crack occurred and the time to notice maintenance could be controlled.

The difficulties encountered in the service life management are due to the uncertainties associated with detecting and identifying structural damages, and assessing and predicting the structural performance. To reduce these uncertainties, continuous long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) can be employed. However, a rational and practical SHM planning is required to simultaneously maximize the accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness in service life management. This paper proposes a probabilistic optimum SHM planning based on five objectives to be simultaneously optimized: minimizing the expected damage detection delay, minimizing the expected maintenance delay, maximizing the damage detection time-based reliability index, maximizing the expected service life extension, and minimizing the expected life-cycle cost.

Abstract = {This study presents prediction of crack propagation in polycrystalline materials under cyclic loads using Peridynamic (PD) theory. The PD fatigue model utilizes the strain-load cycle (ε-N) data and introduces the "remaining life" of each bond calculated from its cyclic strain, which changes over time. The model also captures the traditional Paris law, which is widely used for computing the fatigue crack growth. Moreover, a new crack tip detection algorithm is introduced to adaptively detect the crack tip which is necessary for the PD fatigue model. Finally, several numerical cases are considered to investigate the effect of the strength of grain boundaries and the size of grains on the fatigue behaviour of polycrystalline materials. • Peridynamic fatigue analysis is performed for polycrystalline materials. • A new crack tip detection algorithm is proposed. • Effect of the strength of grain boundaries on fatigue behaviour is investigated. • Effect of size of grains on fatigue behaviour)},

To detect stiffness degradation that results from the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks, an automated damage detection framework was proposed by the authors (Eftekhar Azam et al., 2019; Rageh et al., 2018). The proposed method relies on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify damage location and intensity under non-stationary, unknown train loads. Bridge computational models were used to simulate damage scenarios and for training the ANNs.

Abstract = {Biological long short-term memory (B-LSTM) can effectively help human process all kinds of received information. In this work, a memristive B-LSTM circuit which mimics a conversion from short-term memory to long-term memory is proposed. That is, the stronger the signal, the more profound the memory and the higher the output. On this basis, an image binarization circuit using adaptive row threshold algorithm is proposed. It can make the image remain a deep impression on the strong pixel information and effectively filter the relatively weak pixel information. In combination with the function of image binarization, a memristive circuit for eyes state detection is proposed by adding corresponding horizontal projection calculation, subtraction calculation and judgement open or closed eyes modules. The proposed circuit can detect whether there is a blink between two adjacent facial images, which uses the characteristics of memristor to detect the difference of horizontal projection between)},

Abstract = {Traffic accidents are caused by driver fatigue or distraction in many cases. To prevent accidents, several low-cost hypovigilance (hypo-V) systems were developed in the past based on a multimodal-hybrid (physiological and behavioral) feature set. Similarly in this paper, real-time driver inattention and fatigue (Hypo-Driver) detection system is proposed through multi-view cameras and biosignal sensors to extract hybrid features. The considered features are derived from non-intrusive sensors that are related to the changes in driving behavior and visual facial expressions. To get enhanced visual facial features in uncontrolled environment, three cameras are deployed on multiview points (0◦, 45◦, and 90◦) of the drivers. To develop a Hypo-Driver system, the physiological signals (electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electro-myography (sEMG), and electrooculography (EOG)) and behavioral information (PERCLOS70-80-90%, mouth aspect ratio (MAR), eye aspect ratio (EAR), b)},

Abstract = {Under the cyclic traffic loads, welded structural components of steel bridges may encounter fatigue, which can cause a shorter service life and lead to fracture. A precise fatigue life prediction of structural components requires an accurate collection of stress cycles of the respective component. The density of sensors installed for monitoring the component and the distance to the concentrated stress areas are the features, which impact the efficacy of the estimated fatigue life. In this study, a platform is developed for the data-driven fatigue assessment of welded structural components of steel bridges, using artificial neural networks (ANN). The proposed algorithm is implemented for a case study, vertical lift truss bridge, the Memorial Bridge, Portsmouth, NH. A 12-month data collection period is utilized for the algorithm, from the long-term SHM program of the bridge. The stress cycles are used to estimate fatigue responses of an instrumented structural component of the bridge an)},

However, the current vehicle-mounted embedded device has insufficient memory and limited computing power, which cannot complete the real-time detection of driver fatigue based on deep learning.

First, a lightweight object detection network is designed, which can quickly identify the opening and closing states of the driver's eyes and mouth in the time series video. Secondly, the EYE-MOUTH (EM) driver fatigue detection model is designed, which encodes the driver's eye and mouth opening and closing state, and calculates the driver's PERCLOS (Percentage of Eyelid Closure over the Pupil) and FOM (Frequency of Open Mouth) according to the coding sequence.

A reduced-order nonlinear oscillator model is tailored to illuminate the contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN) and the nonlinear resonance phenomena. The analytical formulation considers the rough surface condition of the fatigue cracks, with a crack open–close transitional range for the effective modeling of the variable-stiffness nonlinear mechanism. Multiple damage indices (DIs) associated with the degree of nonlinearity of the interrogated structures are then proposed by correlating the ultrasonic resonance spectra.

Abstract = {Fatigue cracks are often underestimated by traditional linear ultrasonic techniques due to the poor direction as well as narrow gaps within the cracks. The nonlinear ultrasonic testing technique is a promising method that may be used to solve this problem. In this study, the effects of traditional C scan imaging in measuring fatigue cracks are analyzed by comparing their results with that of metallography. Then, the finite amplitude method of nonlinear ultrasonic testing is used to detect micro-damages, and the influences of excitation voltage on the nonlinear coefficient are investigated. The results indicated that the accuracy in C scan imaging becomes worse when the crack's surface is not perpendicular to the incident wave or if the crack's gap is very small. In contrast, relative nonlinear coefficients under an optimum voltage increase according to the degree of micro-damage, which was found to not be affected by the status of macro-cracks but was particularly sensitive to the acc)},

For this purpose, guided wave propagation and interaction with microcrack in a pipe structure, which introduced a contact acoustic nonlinearity, was analysed through a finite element analysis in which the material nonlinearity was also included. To validate the simulation results, experimental testing was performed using piezoelectric transducers to generate guided waves in a specimen with a fatigue crack. Both methods revealed that the second harmonic wave generated by the breathing behaviour of the microcrack in a pipe had multiple wave modes, unlike the plate scenario using nonlinear guided waves. Therefore, a proper index which considered all the generated wave modes due to the microcrack was developed to quantify the nonlinearity, facilitating the identification of )},

The method involved analysing specific frames to determine that a blink occurred, and then monitoring the time between successive blinks. The program was simulated in python using a Raspberry Pi Zero and a standard USB camera. For the blink rate detection block, a gate level schematic was implemented in Cadence software using 65 nm CMOS technology. The design was based around an asynchronous 6-bit based edge counter which was designed using D-flip-flops. The simulation calculated the average blink rate and compared this to the most recent blink rate. The outcome would determine if an alarm signal should be sent to the alarm.

The algorithm is designed for automation of measurements of the crack propagation parameter and tracing the crack tip position in the course of cyclic loading for the purpose of shifting the optical system with respect to the examined sample surface to the 'region of interest.' It is found that the coordinates of the image fragment containing the crack can be determined with a mean error of 1.93% of the total size of the raster. Testing of the algorithm on model images shows that the mean error of determining the crack tip position is smaller than 56 pixels.

Abstract = {This article presents an improved nonlinear ultrasonic technique for fatigue damage detection utilizing a kind of carefully designed aluminum-lead composite metamaterial. It focuses on developing a bandgap metamaterial to improve the accuracy and identifiability of the superharmonic features from fatigue cracks by eliminating the inherent nonlinear components in the nonlinear ultrasonic technique. The study starts with the unit cell design through modal analysis by applying the Bloch–Floquet boundary condition to obtain the band structure. Based on the local resonance mechanism, by adjusting the height ratio between the aluminum and lead cylinders, the bandgaps covering the required frequency ranges can be opened up. Then, a chain of regularly arranged unit cells is modeled to analyze the spectral response and verify the bandgap effect through harmonic analysis. The targeted ultrasonic frequency component of guided waves within the bandgap can be mechanically filtered out. Subsequentl)},
