   abstract = {This paper describes the design for a personal mental health virtual assistant with novel ambient intelligence integration-PerMEASS. It is specifically designed to provide help for three mental health issues: stress, anxiety and depression. Its assistance in these issues is based on two very closely related and trending multidisciplinary computer science fields-persuasive technology and digital behavior change intervention, which both research ways to affect human behavior or attitudes with technology, but without co-ercion or deception. A short overview of such assistants focuses on three of them, which represent state of the art. PerMEASS is described in more detail and compared to state of the art to showcase how it advances the existing solutions. The focus is on two parts of PerMEASS' cognitive architecture that present novel contributions: 1) a model of the theory of mind, a cognitive ability to understand other people and act appropriately, 2) an integration with ambient intelligence artificial intelligence in the environment-in the form of a smart bracelet. PerMEASS' theory of mind is used to build a user model and utilize mental health and behavior change ontologies to devise effective and personalized strategies. At the same time, reinforcement learning is used to evaluate the strategies in real-time and use only the ones that are successful, making PerMEASS very adap-tive. PerMEASS uses a smart bracelet to achieve this goal as well. The integration of the assistant with a device to collect biophysiolog-ical data in real-time pushes the assistant technology into new, so far unexplored directions. Our future work consists of firm implementation of the design and testing it in randomized controlled trials.},

   abstract = {In the past decades, there have been numerous advancements in the field of technology. This has led to many scientific breakthroughs in the field of medical sciences. In this, rapidly transforming world we are having a difficult time and the problem of fatigue is becoming prevalent. So, this study aimed to understand what is fatigue, its repercussions, and techniques to detect it using machine learning (ML) approaches. This paper introduces, discusses methods and recent advancements in the field of fatigue detection. Further, we categorized the methods that can be used to detect fatigue into four diverse groups, i.e., Mathematical Models, Rule-Based Implementation, ML and Deep Learning. This study presents, compares and contrasts various algorithms to find the most promising approach that can be used for the detection of fatigue. Finally, the paper discusses the possible areas for improvement.},

   abstract = {Objective: To understand impacts of social, behavioral and physical factors on well-being of office workstation users during COVID-19 work from home (WFH). Methods: A questionnaire was deployed from April 24 to June 11, 2020 and 988 responses were valid. Linear regression, multinomial logistic regression and chi-square tests were used to understand factors associated with overall physical and mental health statuses and number of new physical and mental health issues. Results: Decreased overall physical and mental well-being after WFH were associated with physical exercise, food intake, communication with coworkers, children at home, distractions while working, adjusted work hours, workstation set-up and satisfaction with workspace indoor environmental factors. Conclusion: This study highlights factors that impact workers' physical and mental health well-being while WFH and provides a foundation for considering how to best support a positive WFH experience.},
